# check-file-size-ratchet.sh — line-count ratchet for non-test Go files.
#
# Blocks new growth in oversized ("god") files while grandfathering the ones
# that already exist (crux#20):
#
#   - a non-test .go file listed in the baseline fails the gate when it grows
#     beyond its recorded line count;
#   - an unlisted non-test .go file fails the gate when it exceeds LIMIT lines.
#
# Shrinking is always allowed. When a listed file is now smaller than its
# baseline (or no longer over LIMIT, or gone), the gate still passes and prints
# the exact baseline line to edit, so a split can lower the ratchet in the same
# pull request.
#
# Baseline format: one "<lines> <path>" entry per line, path relative to the
# module root; blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
#
# Lives under .github/ because the crux-publish sync replaces every other path.
#
# Usage: .github/scripts/check-file-size-ratchet.sh [baseline]
#   Run from the module root. The baseline defaults to
#   .github/go-file-size-ratchet.txt. Exit 0 = pass, 1 = ratchet violated,
#   2 = usage or malformed baseline.
